This may be obligatory to avoid trouble. I dunno. I see it on a lot of channels like mine, so... monkey see, monkey do. 
This is just a fun channel to share my favorite VGM tracks. I hope that there will be some tracks that you recognize and bring back some nostalgia for you, but at the same time I hope to bring in some tracks that many may have never heard before. No real order, just random selections from my collection. (All tracks, images and, yes, even fonts belong to their respective owners! None of which are me, lol! No copyright infringements are intended and no profit gained from these videos. They are purely for personal entertainment.)
